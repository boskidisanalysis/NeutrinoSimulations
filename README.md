# Neutrino Production in Supernova stars

Using Grok 3 as a helping tool we tried to simulate the generation of high energy neutrinos from the interaction of protons with the shockwave from the collapsing supernova. 

## Methodology

To simulate the first-order acceleration of particles in supernova shock fronts, produce ultra-high-energy neutrinos, and study their flow and properties, including detection on Earth, we'll create a Python script. This simulation will model diffusive shock acceleration (first-order Fermi acceleration), neutrino production via proton-proton interactions, and the resulting neutrino spectrum and flux at Earth. We'll use appropriate scientific libraries: NumPy for numerical computations, SciPy for integration, and Matplotlib for visualization. I'll choose a hypothetical Type II supernova in our galaxy capable of accelerating particles to ultra-high energies (up to 10¹⁸ eV), as this aligns with your interest in ultra-high-energy neutrinos.
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the simulation:
1. Model the Supernova Shock and Particle Acceleration: Assume protons are accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration, producing a power-law energy spectrum.

2. Neutrino Production: Simulate proton-proton collisions in the shock region, generating neutrinos with energies ~5% of the proton energies.

3. Neutrino Spectrum and Flux: Calculate the neutrino spectrum and fluence at Earth, considering the supernova’s distance.

4. Detection on Earth: Estimate the number of detectable neutrinos using a simplified detector model (e.g., inspired by IceCube).

5. Visualization: Plot the neutrino energy spectrum and detected events.
